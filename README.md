# warpaint-language

A Garmin Connect IQ widget with translations of 2 selected languages.

## Development

Create flags in different sizes for new watch sizes - with python script.

## Description

The Warpaint Language is a unique widget that was created to help Garmin users learn the most used words and phrases in different languages for free. I used many translators but as I don't speak most of the available languages it may contain mistakes (especially with genders and with words which have noun and verb forms too). It is much appreciated if you report any issues with the translations or apply to proofread any languages. In these cases please send me a message via 'Contact Developer' option.
More languages are coming but if you have any desired one let me know and I will put to the beggining of the queue according to the number of request.

The Warpaint Language is fully free, however if you enjoy using it you can support my work with a small donation on the following link: https://paypal.me/WarpaintVision (Please mention the name of the app: "Warpaint Language" and choose the option "donate to a friend" for less paypal fees).

Please leave a review if you like the widget!

### Features:

### Settings you can change (it depends on what the watch supports):

- You can select from which language you want the translations and the target language as well.
- The languages' names and some instructional text will be shown in your device's current language setting.

### Notes/FAQ:

- You can reach the settings menu by pressing and holding on the main page on the words on touchscreens, or by pressing and holding the menu button on devices with dedicated menu button.
- The Warpaint Language needs bluetooth connection to a phone which connects to the internet in order to download words. It downloads 25 words/phrases at once and usually takes 1-5 seconds. After connection is established, press the Warpaint Vision logo at the bottom on touchscreens or press the 'next' button.
- To reveal a translation you need to touch the 'REVEAL' text (white background) on touchscreens or press the 'next' button.
- To get the next translation you need to press the Warpaint Vision logo at the bottom on touchscreens or press the 'next' button.
- You can reach the Statistics page by pressing the flags on top of the main page (only on touchcreens) or by selecting it from the the menu.
- You can reach the Total words page by touching the statistics page anywhere on touchscreens or by pressing the 'next' button.
- To move back to the previous page you need to swipe left on touchscreens (or right, depending on your watch settings) or press the 'back' button.
- Warpaint Language does not collect or forward any personal data. It only collects anonymously the learned words per language per month for statistical purposes.
